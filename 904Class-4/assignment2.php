//Question 02: 

//If we print 1-100, our output will be 100 times. But this time you have print out only the odd (বিজোড়) number within 1-100.

//You have to rotate from 1 to 100.

//Your output message should like that, “3 is a odd number”

//Not need to print even number


for ($n=0; $n <= 100; $n++) { 
   
   if ($n % 2 !== 0) {

     echo "$n is A ODD Number <br>";

   }
