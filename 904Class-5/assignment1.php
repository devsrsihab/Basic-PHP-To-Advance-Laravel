/*Question 01: 

We have an array [12,34,2,6,78]. What kind of array is this? Find allprime numbers from this array.

Step 1: First let us find the factors of the given number( factors are the number that completely divides the given number)

Step 2: Then check the total number of factors of that number

Step 3: Hence, If the total number of factors is more than two, it is not a prime number but a composite number. Because When a number is divisible by only one and itself, then it is a prime number. */
